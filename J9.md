1. What is the difference between a functional and non-functional requirement?

A functional requirement is more descriptive as to what the software requirements are and
non-functional requirement is usually some kind of "-ity" that isn't generally something 
that a single developer could code because is less descriptive and broad.


2. Give two example functional requirements for Instagram.com.

    1- To add text to a story the system should offer the user with a place to choose the font.

    2- The system should offer a setting where users can decide wheter they want their account to 
    be private or public.


3. Give two example non-functional requirements for Instagram.com.

    1- Has to show the user's name

    2- People can use from any operating system


4. Draw a use case diagram for Instagram.com with at least three uses cases shown, 
where at least one use case extends another, and there are two actors.

5. Why has software engineering evolved to often embrace agile development models over waterfall ones?

It is generally impossible to obtain concise and complete requirements at the start of a software project, 
as the waterfall model assumes. Therefore, agile approaches can be used to have flexibility around the requirements 
discovery that inevitably happens during the software development process.

6. Draw a diagram where there are at least two interconnected paths: a critical path, and at least one non-critical path.


7. What is the difference between a design pattern and a java library?

The design pattern is just a template, it looks code-like but is not code that compiles.

8. Using the Singleton pattern, write code/pseudocode that ensures that only one database 
connection object is ever instantiated.

public class DBSingleton {

    private static DBSingleton singletonInstance;

    private static DBConnection connection;

    private DBSingleton(String user, String password, String schema) {

        connection = new DBConnection(user, password, schema);
    }

    public static synchronized DBSingleton getInstance() {

        if (singletonInstance == null) {

            singletonInstance = new DBSingleton("kinga", "passy", "book_database");
        }

        return singletonInstance;
    }
}

9. Assume there is an Animal abstract parent class that has the following constructor: 
public Animal(String name, int weight).
Using the Factory pattern, write code/pseudocode that sets up a factory for two child classes of 
Animal: Bird and Mammal. Each of these has a constructor with the same arguments as those of the parent class.

public class AnimalFactory {

    public static Animal getAnimal(String type, String name, int weight){

        switch(type){

            case “bird”:

            return new Bird(name, weight);

            case “beast”:

            return new Mammal(name, weight);
        }

    return null;

    }

}


10. Imagine we have some code for an aquarium that works nicely to schedule feeding the fish 
in all the tanks, and cleaning the tanks:

public class MammalAdapter extends Fish {

    private Mammal mammal;

    public MammalAdapter(Mammal m){

        mammal = m;
    }

    public void feed(String food, int weight) {

        return mammal.feed(food, weight, “antibiotics”);

    }

    public void clean(String cleaningProduct) {

        mammal.clean();

    }

}

11. What is the benefit of the Bridge design pattern? Why use one?

Refactoring your code using the Bridge design pattern eliminates the state space explosion of having a 
separate class for all the possible combinations of the N dimensions of features the system must model. 
When adding a new dimension with two options, you don’t need to double the number of classes you have; you 
can just add a single field to your main class.


12. When would you use Java over C++? C++ over Java?



13. What is static versus dynamic typing? How is dynamic binding related to these concepts?
